# ELI — Eternal Liquidity Instruments (V1 Standard)
*Immutable Liquidity. Zero Governance. Stewardship on Ethereum Classic.*

---

## Overview
ELI (Eternal Liquidity Instruments) is a liquidity standard built for Ethereum Classic (ETC), designed to create **immutable, unowned, permanent liquidity** using a novel mechanism: burning LP tokens to the dead wallet.

This creates a dual-layer liquidity architecture:

- **Hard Liquidity (HL)** — Unowned, permanent, ossified base liquidity  
- **Soft Liquidity (SL)** — Flexible, human-layer liquidity that can be added, removed, leveraged, or used for yield

The result is a **zero-governance DeFi foundation** that can operate indefinitely, aligning perfectly with ETC’s immutability and stewardship ethos.

---

## Why ELI Exists
Most DeFi systems suffer from:

- Governance capture  
- Upgrades that break assumptions  
- Admin control  
- Liquidity rugging  
- Endless parameter tuning  
- Protocol drift  
- Fragile L2/L3 dependency  

ELI solves this at the root by removing the **possibility** of control:

- LP tokens are burned into a dead wallet  
- The AMM is immutable  
- Yield logic is immutable  
- No governance layer exists  
- No upgrades  
- No multisigs  
- No admin keys  

This creates **settlement-grade liquidity** that behaves like economic bedrock.

---

## Core Principles
ELI is built on six foundational principles:

1. **Immutability** — Once deployed, nothing can be changed  
2. **Ossification** — Liquidity becomes permanent economic mass  
3. **Neutrality** — No entity owns or governs the base layer  
4. **Stewardship** — The protocol acts as a caretaker, not a ruler  
5. **Simplicity** — Minimal surface area, maximal longevity  
6. **Zero Governance** — No human coordination required

## Dual-Layer Liquidity Model

### 🟩 Hard Liquidity (HL)
Liquidity burned into the dead wallet becomes:

- Unowned  
- Unremovable  
- Unforkable  
- Neutral  
- Permanent  
- Settlement-grade  

It is the **bone layer** of the system — an economic fossil that grows over time.

### 🟦 Soft Liquidity (SL)
Optional liquidity users add intentionally:

- Withdrawable  
- Incentivizable  
- Collateralizable  
- Volatile  
- Yield-bearing  

SL creates market flexibility **without compromising** HL.

## The ELI Cycle (The “8”)
ELI encodes a natural cycle of **creation → destruction → rebirth**, forming an infinite loop:

1. Trade occurs  
2. Fee is generated  
3. Fee mints new LP  
4. LP is burned (destroyed)  
5. Hard Liquidity increases (reborn)  
6. AMM becomes stronger  
7. More volume flows through  
8. Cycle repeats  

This forms the **ELI Flywheel**, a self-reinforcing loop powered by usage.

---

## Why ETC Is the Natural Home for ELI
ETC provides a unique environment:

- PoW finality  
- Immutable ethos  
- No governance culture  
- Long-term settlement stability  
- No sequencer politics  
- Minimal protocol churn  

Other chains are too upgrade-heavy, too politicized, or too dependent on L2 governance to support genuine ossification.

## Status
**Draft Specification — V1**  
ELI is intentionally simple, immutable, and permanent.  
Future versions will **add new standards**, not alter existing ones.
