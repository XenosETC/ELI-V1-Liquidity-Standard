### **ELI Standard – Terminology & Definitions**

*Version 1.0 – Xenos*

---

# **1. Core Terms**

## **ELI — Eternal Liquidity Instrument**

A new asset class defined by immutable, burned liquidity paired with ETC and enforced by PoW.
An ELI asset must follow:

* PoBL
* PoBLBS
* Zero-governance liquidity
* Tokenomics that do not undermine LP

---

## **PoBL — Proof of Burn Liquidity**

The act of **permanently burning LP tokens** to a dead address, making liquidity:

* unwithdrawable
* unmigratable
* unguidable
* irreversible

PoBL transforms liquidity into a **public good secured by ETC**.

---

## **PoBLBS — Proof of Burn Liquidity Balance Sheet**

A verifiable on-chain accounting document reflecting:

* ETC permanently locked
* Token permanently locked
* Liquidity depth
* Reserve ratios
* Immutable backing
* Long-term collateral strength

PoBLBS is the financial record of an ELI asset.

---

## **ZGF — Zero Governance Finance**

A liquidity and economic model where:

* no DAO
* no multisig
* no governance votes
* no upgrade paths
* no administrative control

The system behaves as **objective, immutable infrastructure**.

---

## **Hard Liquidity**

Liquidity that:

* cannot be moved, removed, or governed
* is enforced by PoW
* is permanently burned into the AMM

Opposite of “soft liquidity,” which can vanish.

---

## **Immutable Liquidity**

Liquidity that persists indefinitely because LP tokens were burned permanently.
The AMM pair cannot lose its base liquidity.

---

## **Timechain Reinforcement**

The economic effect where:

* volatility
* arbitrage
* ETC appreciation
* market depth changes

…strengthen the LP base over time.

---

## **LP Floor**

The **minimum guaranteed liquidity depth** that can never be withdrawn.

---

# **2. Tokenomics Terms**

## **50/25/25 Model**

Recommended ELI tokenomics:

* **50% burned supply**
* **25% burned LP** (PoBL)
* **25% ecosystem incentives** (vested)

Ensures scarcity + integrity + growth.

---

## **Ecosystem Incentives**

Tokens reserved for:

* staking
* development
* listings
* grants
* promotion

With strict rules:

* MUST be vested
* MUST NOT undermine LP
* MUST NOT be dumped into liquidity

---

## **Anti-Fragile Liquidity**

Liquidity that **benefits** from volatility, because AMM mechanics reinforce reserves.

---

# **3. ETC Philosophy Terms**

## **Social Layer Innovation**

Improving how humans use ETC **without modifying the protocol**.

## **Governance Mutation**

Any attempt to add governance to ETC’s immutable base (rejected by ELI philosophy).

## **Stewardship**

Builders maintain systems responsibly without introducing control mechanisms.

## **Sound Liquidity**

Liquidity that behaves predictably across decades—similar to sound money principles.
